A modern, minimalist logo for QuickPay, featuring a stylized coin shape with a blue and green gradient background, symbolizing speed, trust, and financial transactions. The coin shape is centered, with a subtle shadow and a small arrow pointing upward to represent sending money. The background is a smooth gradient from deep blue at the top to bright green at the bottom, giving a fresh, dynamic feel. The overall design is clean, flat, and suitable for a mobile app image.
